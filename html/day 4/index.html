    The time in Arles, France became one of Van Gogh's more 
    prolific periods: he completed 200 paintings and 
    more than 100 drawings and watercolors. He was 
    enchanted by the local countryside and light; 
    his works from this period are rich in yellow, 
    ultramarine, and mauve.

    <h3>Impressionism</h3>
    <p>
      Impressionism is a 19th-century art movement characterized 
      by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open 
      composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its 
      changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage 
      of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of movement as a 
      crucial element of human perception and experience, and 
      unusual visual angles.
    </p>

        <p class="div-div">
            The Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional 
            art community in France. The name of the style derives from the 
            title of a Claude Monet work, Impression, soleil levant 
            (Impression, Sunrise), which provoked the critic Louis Leroy 
            to coin the term in a satirical review published in the 
            Parisian newspaper Le Charivari.
          </p>
    <p>
      The <em >development of Impressionism </em>in the visual arts was soon 
      followed by analogous styles in other media that became known 
      as impressionist music and impressionist literature.
